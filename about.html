        <h2>Mishel Kora</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Mishel Kora. I am a rising high school junior who's really passionate about exploring my passions. One of them is travelling. A lot of people have never heard about Albania, but you would be amazed at what a beautiful country it is. Being born there, I have a special and emotional connection to this country that I would like to share with anyone who wants to learn more about different places. If you'd like to learn more about Albania, please go through the website.</p>
